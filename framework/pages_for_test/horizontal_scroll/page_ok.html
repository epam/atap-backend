  <title>Applet 7.1: Mean of the Sample Mean</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Mean of the Sample Mean</span><br>
</h3>
<p>From Formula 7.1 of your book, you know that, for each sample size,
the mean of all possible samples means equals the population mean.
Using the applet below, you can make this fact plausible. Note the
following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first plot displays the population distribution (for which
several
options are available through the first drop-down list box). Each
distribution can be changed
interactively by clicking and dragging the mouse on the plot. The
Custom option provides a blank plot on which a distribution can be
constructed. <br>
  </li>
  <li>When you click the <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><b>Sample</b>
button, <b>N</b>
simple random samples of size <b>n</b> are selected from the
population. The sample statistics
specified by the drop-down list boxes in the bottom two plots are
updated for each
sample. <br>
  </li>
  <li>If <b>N</b> is set to 1 and <b>n</b> is at most 50, the display
shows in an animated fashion the observations from the population
dropping into the second
plot and the appropriate summary statistics dropping into the
third and fourth plots.</li>
  <li>If <span style="font-weight: bold;">N </span>is
greater than 1, the second plot shows the sample data for the last
sample only.</li>
  <li>To stop an animation, click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset
    </span>button. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The numerical values of summary statistics
for each plot are shown in
the panel to the left of the plot.</li>
</ul>

Here we concentrate on the mean of the sample means, shown in <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">green </span>in the third plot.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uniform </span>from the
drop-down list box next to the first plot.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>What is the population mean?</li>
    <li>Use your answer from part (a) to determine the mean of all
possible sample means for samples of size 10.</li>
    <li>If you took 1000 samples of size 10, roughly what value would
you expect for the mean of the sample means of the 1000 samples?
Explain your answer.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use the applet to simulate 1000 samples of size 10 from the
population.</li>
    <li>What is the mean of the sample means of the 1000 samples?</li>
    <li>Compare your answers in parts (c) and (e) and discuss any
discrepancy that you observe.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>Repeat problem 1 for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bell
Shaped</span> population distribution.</li>
  <li>Repeat problem 1 for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skewed </span>population
distribution.</li>
