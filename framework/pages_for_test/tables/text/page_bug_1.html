            Your Inventory table is not correctly normalized as it includes redundancies.&nbsp; You need to decompose it into set of related tables like this:<br>
<br>
Products:<br>
....ProductID (PK)<br>
....ProductName<br>
....SupplierID<br>
....etc.<br>
<br>
Colors<br>
....Color (PK)<br>
<br>
Sizes<br>
....Size (PK)<br>
<br>
You have a many-to-many relationship type between Products and Colors, and between Products and Sizes.&nbsp; A many-to-many relationship type is modelled by a table which resolves the relationship type into two or more one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; So to model
 the relationship type between Products and Colors you'd have a table:<br>
<br>
ProductColors<br>
....ProductID (FK)<br>
....Color (FK)<br>
<br>
and for that between Products and Sizes:<br>
<br>
ProductSizes<br>
....ProductID (FK)<br>
....Size (FK)<br>
<br>
The primary key of each of these tables is a composite one made up of the two columns in each case; the tables are said to ne 'all key'.&nbsp; These two tables are themselves related in a many-to-many relationship type, which is modelled by a further table.&nbsp; It
 is this table which is the Inventory table if you are simply recording the current stock position and storage location for each product:<br>
<br>
Inventory<br>
....ProductID (FK)<br>
....Color (FK)<br>
....Size (FK)<br>
....StockInHand<br>
....StorageLocation<br>
<br>
The primary key of this table is again a composite one, this time made up of the three columns ProductID, Color, and Size,&nbsp; As no part of a primary key can be Null, each product must have both a colour and a size.&nbsp; This won't be appropriate in some cases of
 course, so in the both the Sizes and Colors table you must include a row with a value N/A or similar.&nbsp; The other imporatnt point is that ProductID and Color on the one hand, and ProductID and Size on the other hand are each composite foreign keys referencing
 the composite primary keys of ProductColors and ProductSizes respectively, so the relationships with thse tables should be on the two columns in each case.<br>
<br>
You might be wondering why ProductSizes and ProductColors tables are needed at all.&nbsp; It would be possible to operate the database without these tables, with the Inventory table modelling a ternary (3-way) many-to-many relationship type between Products, Colors
 and Sizes, but it would be perfectly possible to insert a row into this table which included a size or colour inappropriate to the product in question.<br>
<br>
If we take Men's Wicking Polo as an example, there would be one row for this in Products.&nbsp; If this is available in S, M and L sizes there would be three rows in ProductSizes with the same ProductID value, 42 say, and S, M and L in the Size column.&nbsp; If it is
 available in red and blue in the S and M sizes, but only in blue in the L size, then in the Inventory table there would be the following rows:<br>
<br>
    <div>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Red<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blue<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;M&nbsp;&nbsp; Red<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;L&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blue<br>
    </div>
<br>
In each row would be the current stock in hand, storage location etc of each in other columns in the table.<br>
<br>
This is a very simple inventory system where the quantities in stock are updated as items are added to or removed from stock.&nbsp; In most cases however, the stock level would not be stored, but computed on the basis of individual transactions.&nbsp; The current stock
 in hand is simply the sum of the quantities per item added to stock less the sum of the quantities per item removed from stock.&nbsp; You'll find a very simple example of this which I put together a while ago for another user here as Inventory.zip in my public
 databases folder at:<br>

<br>
As well as purchases and sales you'd need to take account of other things such as stock written off or adjustments as a result of a stock-take.&nbsp; In real life inventory databases can be very complex.<br>
