<br>
Not quite; what you'd have would be this:<br>
<br>
Table Name: Products<br>
<br>
    <div>
        ProductID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ProductName<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men's Wicking Polo<br>
    </div>
<br>
Table Name: Colors<br>
<br>
Color<br>
Red<br>
Blue<br>
<br>
Table Name: Sizes<br>
<br>
Size<br>
S<br>
M<br>
L<br>
XL<br>
<br>
Table Name: ProductColors<br>
<br>
    <div>
        ProductID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Color<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Red<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue<br>
    </div>
<br>
Table Name: ProductSizes<br>
<br>
    <div>
        ProductID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; S<br>
        42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M<br>
    </div>
<br>
Table Name: Inventory<br>
<br>
<div>
    ProductID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Color&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StockInHand<br>
    42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>
    42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Red&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8<br>
    42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Blue&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11<br>
    42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br>
</div>
<br>
These rows mean that there are 15 small red men's wicking polo shirts in stock, 8 medium red, 11 medium blue and 5 large blue.&nbsp; Further rows would represent other colors and sizes of men's wicking polo shirts stocked and the same would be true of other products
 represented in the Products table and for which there would also be rows in the ProductColors and ProductSizes tables which would represent the colors and sizes appropriate to each product.&nbsp; Note that there must be at least one row in each of these tables,
 so if we take your example of Crinkle Cut Paper, for which we'll assume a ProductId of 66, there would be one row in Products for this, two rows in ProductColors and, as this product apparently does not have sizes a row in ProductSizes:<br>
<br>
<div>
    ProductID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size<br>
    66&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; N/A<br>
</div>
<br>
The Sizes table would have a row with a value N/a.&nbsp; The ProductSizes table is modelling a many-to-many relationship type between Products and Sizes.&nbsp; It's key is a composite one of the two columns because, in combination, these must be distinct within the table,
 e.g. you can only have one row with a ProductID of 42 and a Size of M.&nbsp; Even if you were to introduce an autonumber column ProductSizeID as the primary key the other two columns would still be a key, what's known as a candidate key, so would have to be included
 in a unique index to prevent duplicates.<br>
<br>
What you have here is a set of tables. each of which represents and entity type, e.g. products or colors, but some of those entity types are relationship types between other entity type, e.g. ProductColors.&nbsp; The tables are normalized, which is the formal process
 for eliminating redundancy by 'decomposing' a table which includes redundancy in to two or more related tables.&nbsp; Redundancy is when the same 'fact' is stated more than once in a table, in separate rows, or in rows in different tables.&nbsp; This allows for inconsistent
 data to be entered and puts the integrity of the database at risk.<br>
<br>
It's important to understand that the entity type and relationship types in a database have an existence in the real world, because a relational database is a model of the underlying reality.&nbsp; Designing a relational database is essentially the identification
 of these real world entity types and relationship types and representing them as related tables.&nbsp; If the database accurately models the reality it will behave in the same way as the reality being modelled, which is of course exactly what we want it to do.&nbsp;
 So, the importance of getting the model right cannot be overstressed.&nbsp; Once you've done that the interface in terms of the forms and subforms required will by and large be self evident.<br>
<br>
Although it has nothing to do with your specific requirement you might find it helpful to take a look at the file ParentActivities.zip in my SkyDrive folder to which I posted a link earlier.&nbsp; This illustrates a basic many-to-many relationship type, between
 parents and activities (it was originally produced for a user wanting this) and how that relationship type is modelled by tables, and how this is represented in a form/subform.&nbsp; These are the basic building blocks you'll need to use in develop[ping your own
 application.<br>
