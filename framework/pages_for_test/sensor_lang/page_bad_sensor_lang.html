<p>The text between the two horizontal lines is the required reading for this week's home work assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

    <li>The navigation instructions for a site state, "To go to next page,
      press the button to the right. To go back to previous page, press
      the button to the left."
    </li>

    <li>A user is reading a news article in an on-line newspaper. The article
      contains an illustration and additional links for more information.
      Within the text of the article is a statement, "Please see sidebar
      to the left of the illustration for links to additional
      information." An assistive technology user would have difficulty
      finding the illustration and the sidebar. Some alternatives would be
      to include the list of links within the text; to provide an in-page
      link within the text which links to the sidebar; to provide a
      heading for the sidebar which can be used for navigation and refer
      to the heading in the instructions.
    </li>

    <li>A user is completing an on-line survey. There are three buttons at
      the bottom of the survey form. The instructions state, "Press the
      square button to exit the survey without saving, Press the triangle
      button to save in-progress survey results. You may return later to
      complete the survey. Press the round button to submit the survey
      results." A screen reader user or a user unable to distinguish shapes cannot determine
      which button is
      square, triangular, or round. The buttons must have additional
      information to indicate their functions or their shapes.
