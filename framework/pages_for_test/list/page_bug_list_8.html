<p>• &nbsp;Fruit<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; - Apple<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; A very long sentence about oranges, which is probably going to wrap over the line without an indent in a confusing an not particularly attractive manner<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Pear<br>
	•&nbsp; Vegetables<br><span>&nbsp;</span>• &nbsp;Dairy</p>

<h4>Why Is This&nbsp;Wrong?</h4>

<p>A sighted user <strong>can</strong> tell the content is a list by the visual formatting, and can make an assessment of the length of the list, but they are likely to see formatting errors.</p>

<p>A screen reader will announce the items as unrelated paragraphs: it not be able to tell the user that this is a list, or how many items there are in it, or which items were indented. It will also be confusingly announcing the names of the symbols at the start of each new line: "bullet! bullet! dash! dash!"</p>
