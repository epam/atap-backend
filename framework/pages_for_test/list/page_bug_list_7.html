<h4>Why Is This&nbsp;Wrong?</h4>

<p>A sighted user can quickly determine that the content is a list by the visual formatting, and can make an assessment of the length of the list. A non-sighted person using a screen reader would interact with the items as six paragraphs, and not have the programmatic understanding of the outline level of each item.</p>
