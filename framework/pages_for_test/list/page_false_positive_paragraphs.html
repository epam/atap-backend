    <p>Can I upload recordings longer than 15-minutes with the Pro Recorder? You can record for as long as you want but uploads to Screencast-O-Matic.com are still limited to 15-minutes per upload, unless you have the Premier plan.

Can I use on more than one computer?
Yes, as long as it is used by just you, then you can login to our site from any computer and use it. If you have multiple users that need the video editor, then you should take a look at our Team plans.
