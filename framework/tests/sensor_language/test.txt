The point labeled 0 is called the origin. The points are equally spaced to the right of 0 and labeled with the
counting numbers. When a number is paired with a point, it is called the coordinate of the point.

The discovery of the number zero was a big step in the history of mathematics. Including zero with the counting numbers
gives a new set of numbers called the whole numbers. Click on the red circle button.

From Formula 7.1 of your book, you know that, for each sample size, the mean of all possible samples means equals the
population mean. Using the applet below, you can make this fact plausible. Note the following:
The first plot displays the population distribution (for which several options are available through the first drop-down
list box). Each distribution can be changed interactively by clicking and dragging the mouse on the plot.
The Custom option provides a blank plot on which a distribution can be constructed.
When you click the Sample button, N simple random samples of size n are selected from the population.
The sample statistics specified by the drop-down list boxes in the bottom two plots are updated for each sample.
If N is set to 1 and n is at most 50, the display shows in an animated fashion the observations from the population
dropping into the second plot and the appropriate summary statistics dropping into the third and fourth plots.
If N is greater than 1, the second plot shows the sample data for the last sample only.
To stop an animation, click the Reset button.
The numerical values of summary statistics for each plot are shown in the panel to the left of the plot.
Here we concentrate on the mean of the sample means, shown in green in the third plot.
Select Uniform from the drop-down list box next to the first plot.
What is the population mean?
Use your answer from part (a) to determine the mean of all possible sample means for samples of size 10.
If you took 1000 samples of size 10, roughly what value would you expect for the mean of the sample means of the
1000 samples? Explain your answer.

Use the applet to simulate 1000 samples of size 10 from the population.
What is the mean of the sample means of the 1000 samples?
Compare your answers in parts (c) and (e) and discuss any discrepancy that you observe.
Repeat problem 1 for a Bell Shaped population distribution.
Repeat problem 1 for a Skewed population distribution.
